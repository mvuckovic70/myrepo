Find image duplicates POC
--------------------------

Setup

- Data type: unstructured
- Database: mongoDO
- Data size: 34 TB (200 millions of images, each 150 kb)
- Find at least 98% duplicates among all images
- Match accuracy at least 98% each
- Resource-efficiency, implementation & crash control
- Algorithm capable of running on 20 millions of images
- 30.000 new images added weekly and algorithm re-run
- Duplicate: identical one or projection (resized, cropped, watermarked, type changed)

Solution - setup & prerequisites

- OS: Linux Xenial Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit
- Main programming language: Python 3.6
- Environment: Keras with Tensorflow backend
- Database: mongoDB with gridFS

Solution - steps

- Preprocessing: converting images to arrays (one spot activity)
- Total dataset with arrays reduced in size to few hundreds of MB
- Inception ResNetV2 in Keras for similarity calculation and image embedding
- Use rtree library to do the spatial clustering
- Implement similarity fn to spatial indexing clusters
- Setting accyracy threshold
- Calculate similarity as mae, converting to probability metrics
